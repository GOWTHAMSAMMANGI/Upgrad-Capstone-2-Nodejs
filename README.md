# Node.js REST API with Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a Node.js-based RESTful API using Docker and Kubernetes. Additionally, it showcases how to monitor and alert using Prometheus and Grafana.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, Docker Desktop, or a cloud-based solution)
- Prometheus and Grafana set up in your Kubernetes cluster

## Getting Started

Run the following command to start the project:

```bash
mkdir project-2
cd project-2
npm init -y
```

This command will initialize a node.js project in your directory and you have `package.json` file.

### Installing dependencies

For this project we need to install dependencies like `express.js` and `prom-client`. To install the dependencies run the following command:

```bash
npm i express prom-client
```

### Creating configuration file and testing configuration locally

We need a configuration file and we need to create `index.js` file and write the configurations and Run the `node index.js` to test the application whether it is working properly or not.  
Go the the browser and search this address `localhost:3000/metrics` and you will see something like this:

![metrics](./Screenshots/Screenshot%20(93).png "prometheus-metrics")

For more results check the `Screenshots Directory`.

### Containerizing the application

Create a Dockerfile and put the following configuration:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install Node.js dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of your application code to the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port your application is running on
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to start your Node.js application
CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]
```

### Building and tagging and pushing the image to Dockerhub

Now build, tag and push the Docker image form the Dockerfile using the following command:

```bash
Docker build -t iamsauravsingh/crudapp .
Docker push iamsauravsingh/crudapp
```

### Deploy the Image to Kubernetes

In this project we are deploying our manifest file using helm. Run the following command to deploy using helm:

```bash
helm create crud .
```

Write the manifest file for the application and place it to `crud/template` directory. Then run the following command

```bash
helm install crudapp crud
```

This will deploy the application on kubernetes cluster.

### Setting up the Prometheus and Grafana

To install prometheus and Grafana you need to run the following command

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install my-kube-prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --version 51.4.0
```

We are using kube-prometheus-stack because it comes with prometheus all the dependencies which we need to install.

Now edit the service in using `kubectl edit svc` command and expose the grafana service.

Login to Grafana and go to Home > Dashboards > Kubernetes/ComputeResources/Pod and select the pods which we have deployed it looks like this:
